# TradeScrape: A custom scraper for trading insights
TradeScrape is just a script to scrape off some information from specific URLs. This is specific to the context of my activities, it is not a real general Scraper for Trading, since it is just a work pursued as a favor for a friend. If you're interested it may be used as a launchpad to start off with the development of a fresher and better code to make it able to manage multiple heterogeneous pages.
Hope it will result as a source of inspiration for y'all, enjoy!
